= How do the WP Word Count Shortcodes work? =

There are two shortcodes available:

* [wp-word-count] will display the number of words on any page or post.
* [wp-word-count-reading-time] will display the reading time of words on any page or post.

Every WP Word Count shortcode can be extended with "before" and "after" attributes to add text or HTML before and after the result.

Example: [wp-word-count before="This post has" after=" total words."]
